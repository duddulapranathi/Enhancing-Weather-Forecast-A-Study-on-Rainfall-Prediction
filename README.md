# Enhancing-Weather-Forecast-A-Study-on-Rainfall-Prediction
Predicting rainfall trends using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for smarter weather forecasting. 
This project presents a machine learning-based approach to forecast rainfall patterns and weather conditions across districts of Telangana. Using historical meteorological data, the study applies Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM models to predict short-term rainfall with improved accuracy.

Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and visualization through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
The results demonstrate how deep learning models like LSTM can effectively capture temporal patterns for weather prediction and support data-driven climate insights.
